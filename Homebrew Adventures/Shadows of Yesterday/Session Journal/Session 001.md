# Pre-Game
### Cold Open

### Session Overview
Train the PC's are on has been attacked and derailed. Theives (with an airship) are trying to steal the giant crystal being transported to Flamekeep. These thieves are part of the Syndicate.

Syndicate poses the Cyran Codex which supposedly contains the secrets of the Mournlands

### Known NPC's
- Aveneth - Mournlands sourceror. Member of the Syndicate.

### Scenes
- Airship arrives on station on Round 2 (initiative 20)
	- Round 3 - The grapples are attached.
	- Round 4 the crystal is lfted
	- Round 7 the airship takes off

### Secrets and Clues
- "Remember, the Syndicated wants no one alive."
-  "What is Aveneth doing?" " Who knows, I'm not about to question the actions of a Sorceror much less one twisted by the Mourlands"
- "Hey, put that back. We aren't here to steal trivial shit". "Fine." *slamming of a chest*


### Monsters
_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

-   **Deadly Encounter Benchmark:** 1.75
	- Aveneth - .25
	- Bandits - 1/8 * 4 (.25)
	- Guard 1/8 * 4 (.25)*
	- Living Sleep - 1
	- Warforged Solider - 1
