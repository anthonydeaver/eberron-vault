# <center>Arcane Congress</center>

## Overview

**Type**: Magic

**Established**: 01/01/15 BCE 00:00:00

## Background

The Arcane Congress was established by King Galifar I in 15 YK. The Arcane Congress was tasked to study the mysteries of magic and place these powers at the service of the kingdom. The Arcane Congress consists of a council of wizards, artificers and sorcerers who explored the limits of the arcane arts of magic.

 

The Congress has its seat in four floating towers above the village of Arcanix and also uses the Starpeaks Observatory to study the moons and stars. The members of the Congress oversee the towers of wizardry, advise Aundair’s monarch—on all things magical, and confer with colleagues in the other nations—despite a rivalry with the wizards of the Dragonmarked Houses.

 

At the beginning of the Last War, Arcanix was located in western Thrane, but in 895 YK an offensive by Aundair's King Wrogar under the command of Haldren ir'Brassek took control of the lands south of Passage to the Blackcaps and from Ghalt to the shores of Lake Galifar. Since this time, Arcanix and the Arcane Congress have been part of the nation of Aundair.
