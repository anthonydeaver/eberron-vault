## Overview

The Last War was a conflict raging between Aundair, Breland, Cyre, Thrane, and Karrnath. Its purpose was to reunite the Kingdom of Galifar after the succession conflict that occurred upon the death of King Jarot. The conflict lasted over a century and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold in 996 YK.

For hundreds of years the continent of [[Khorvaire]] was united under the Kingdom of [[Galifar]]. This came to an end with the death of King Jarot in 􀀠􀀡􀀜􀀃􀁁􀀳􀀔􀀃􀁒􀁝􀁛􀁜􀀃􀁗􀁞􀁍􀁚􀀃􀁉􀀃􀁋􀁍􀁖􀁜􀁝􀁚􀁡􀀃􀁉􀁏􀁗􀀖􀀃􀀫􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀃􀁗􀁞􀁍􀁚􀀃 the succession spiraled into outright war between the Five Nations.   [[The Last War]] was a bitter struggle that forever changed the shape of [[Khorvaire]]. It was a century marked by shifting alliances, with years of stalemate interspersed with periods of intense 􀁋􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀖􀀃􀀼􀁐􀁑􀁛􀀃􀁏􀁚􀁝􀁍􀁔􀁑􀁖􀁏􀀃􀁋􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀃􀁔􀁍􀁎􀁜􀀃􀁌􀁍􀁍􀁘􀀃􀁛􀁋􀁉􀁚􀁛􀀃􀁗􀁖􀀃 the land and the people, but there was worse to come. On Olarune 20, 994 YK the nation of [[Cyre]] was consumed in a magical cataclysm now known as the Mourning. The cause of the Mourning remains unknown, and many fear that it was a consequence of the extensive use of war magic. Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating table, and [[The Last War|the Last War]] came to an end in 996 YK with the [[Treaty of Thronehold]].   While many celebrated the end of the war, 􀁗􀁜􀁐􀁍􀁚􀁛􀀃􀁚􀁍􀁕􀁉􀁑􀁖􀀃􀁝􀁖􀁛􀁉􀁜􀁑􀁛􀃅􀁍􀁌􀀃􀁟􀁑􀁜􀁐􀀃􀁑􀁜􀁛􀀃􀁗􀁝􀁜􀁋􀁗􀁕􀁍􀀖􀀃 No one won the war, and deep scars remain. War-torn villages and towns are still rebuilding. Once fertile farmlands are scorched and ruined. There are refugees in every major city. And even though people optimistically refer to it as 􀁜􀁐􀁍􀀃􀀴􀁉􀁛􀁜􀀃􀀿􀁉􀁚, most believe that it’s only a matter of time until it begins anew. The mystery of the Mourning is the only thing holding the warmongers at bay. If the secret of the Mourning can be uncovered—if it can be proven that the Mourning couldn’t happen again, or if its power could be harnessed as a weapon—[[The Last War|the Last War]] could begin again. As such, the nations remain in a cold war as each makes preparations and seeks 􀁉􀁌􀁞􀁉􀁖􀁜􀁉􀁏􀁍􀁛􀀃􀁑􀁖􀀃􀁜􀁐􀁍􀀃􀁋􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀃􀁜􀁐􀁉􀁜􀀃􀁋􀁗􀁝􀁔􀁌􀀃􀁔􀁑􀁍􀀃􀁉􀁐􀁍􀁉􀁌􀀖􀀃​

## Backstory

As King Jarot of Galifar approached old age, questions about the succession of his throne ran rampant. Although by tradition, his eldest scion, Princess Mishann of Cyre was to claim the throne, others doubted her ability to rule. Prince Thalin of Thrane felt he was far more fit to rule instead. However, on the king's deathbed in 894 YK, he gave Mishann his blessings and bade Prince Wrogar of Aundair to honor his decision. 

 

At the funeral shortly thereafter, Mishann discussed the details of her coronation with her siblings, but they held a deaf ear to her words. Indeed, they personally threatened to send their soldiers to Thronehold to prevent any such action. Only her brother Wrogar remained allied to Cyre, since he was bound by honor. Later in the year 894 YK hostilities commenced. Alliances were formed, shifted, and were broken over the course of the war. Virtually no part of the continent was unaffected. 

 

The Treaty of Thronehold was signed in 996 YK, two years after the Day of Mourning destroyed Cyre. The treaty effectively put an end to the conflict while at the same time recognizing twelve of the fifteen new nations that had come into existence during the Last War. Although the signatories abide by the treaty, many feel that the current peace will only give way to more warfare. Until one nation defeats the others and claims the throne of the ancient Kingdom of Galifar, many believe there will never be a true and lasting peace.
