House Sivis is a gnome dragonmarked house throughout Khorvaire though they remain strongly based out of Zilargo.

## Profile

The gnomes of House Sivis facilitate communication. This is seen most literally in 􀁛􀁘􀁍􀁉􀁓􀁑􀁖􀁏􀀃􀁛􀁜􀁗􀁖􀁍􀁛, magic items allowing a Sivis heir to send a short message to another speaking stone; House Sivis’s network of message stations is the backbone of long-distance communication. But Sivis also trains and licenses scribes, notaries, interpreters, cartographers, barristers, heralds, bookbinders and more. House Sivis has an especially close relationship with House Kundarak, as Kundarak letters of credit must be notarized with a Sivis arcane mark. 

 

House Sivis has taken great pains to maintain the trust of its clients and takes a position of absolute neutrality in all disputes, whether between houses or nations. Gnomes have a 􀁖􀁉􀁜􀁝􀁚􀁉􀁔􀀃􀁔􀁗􀁞􀁍􀀃􀁗􀁎􀀃􀁑􀁖􀁜􀁚􀁑􀁏􀁝􀁍􀀔􀀃􀁉􀁖􀁌􀀃􀁜􀁐􀁍􀀃􀁌􀁑􀙺􀁍􀁚􀁍􀁖􀁜􀀃􀁎􀁉􀁕􀁑􀁔􀁑􀁍􀁛􀀃 within the house often engage in subtle schemes and feuds, but these are never allowed to threaten the house as a whole. Sivis gnomes are typically friendly, curious, and engaging; but that kindly exterior may conceal a scheming mind.

## Story

The Sivis dragonmark first appeared around 2800 years ago. The gnomes have carefully cultivated the peoples around them since that time and have remained firmly neutral in all conflicts. So, while most people are suspicious of the devious and conniving nature of gnomes, House Sivis has remained above reproach and their services are now indispensible.

 

House Sivis is currently governed by a High Council composed of representatives from each of the nations in which the House operates; this council is currently led by Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis. Lady d'Sivis has led the House for nearly 90 years, since nearly the beginning of the Last War.

## Organization

**Leader(s)**: Doyenee Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis

## Resources

House Sivis possesses the Mark of Scribing. This mark grants various magical benefits related to written and verbal communication. It is through the auspices of Sivis that one can communicate with another across Khorvaire almost instantaneously. House Sivis members also act as translators for diplomats and other dignitaries.
