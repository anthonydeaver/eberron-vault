## Overview

The guild has a virtual monopoly on the repair of mundane objects. Most Dragonmarked heirs of Cannith serve at least two years in the guild. Those dragonmarked who decide that rank and power are not for them sometimes remain in the guild, balancing a lack of respect from others in the house with a life of relative freedom.
