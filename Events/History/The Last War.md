# <center>The Last War</center>

## Overview

**Time Span**: From: 02/20/996 BCE 00:00:00 To: 02/20/996 BCE 00:00:00

## Description

For hundreds of years the continent of Khorvaire was united under the Kingdom of Galifar. This came to an end with the death of King Jarot in 􀀠􀀡􀀜􀀃􀁁􀀳􀀔􀀃􀁒􀁝􀁛􀁜􀀃􀁗􀁞􀁍􀁚􀀃􀁉􀀃􀁋􀁍􀁖􀁜􀁝􀁚􀁡􀀃􀁉􀁏􀁗􀀖􀀃􀀫􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀃􀁗􀁞􀁍􀁚􀀃 the succession spiraled into outright war between the Five Nations.

 

The Last War was a bitter struggle that forever changed the shape of Khorvaire. It was a century marked by shifting alliances, with years of stalemate interspersed with periods of intense 􀁋􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀖􀀃􀀼􀁐􀁑􀁛􀀃􀁏􀁚􀁝􀁍􀁔􀁑􀁖􀁏􀀃􀁋􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀃􀁔􀁍􀁎􀁜􀀃􀁌􀁍􀁍􀁘􀀃􀁛􀁋􀁉􀁚􀁛􀀃􀁗􀁖􀀃 the land and the people, but there was worse to come. On Olarune 20, 994 YK the nation of Cyre was consumed in a magical cataclysm now known as the Mourning. The cause of the Mourning remains unknown, and many fear that it was a consequence of the extensive use of war magic. Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating table, and the Last War came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of Thronehold.

 

While many celebrated the end of the war, 􀁗􀁜􀁐􀁍􀁚􀁛􀀃􀁚􀁍􀁕􀁉􀁑􀁖􀀃􀁝􀁖􀁛􀁉􀁜􀁑􀁛􀃅􀁍􀁌􀀃􀁟􀁑􀁜􀁐􀀃􀁑􀁜􀁛􀀃􀁗􀁝􀁜􀁋􀁗􀁕􀁍􀀖􀀃 No one won the war, and deep scars remain. War-torn villages and towns are still rebuilding. Once fertile farmlands are scorched and ruined. There are refugees in every major city. And even though people optimistically refer to it as 􀁜􀁐􀁍􀀃􀀴􀁉􀁛􀁜􀀃􀀿􀁉􀁚, most believe that it’s only a matter of time until it begins anew. The mystery of the Mourning is the only thing holding the warmongers at bay. If the secret of the Mourning can be uncovered—if it can be proven that the Mourning couldn’t happen again, or if its power could be harnessed as a weapon—the Last War could begin again. As such, the nations remain in a cold war as each makes preparations and seeks 􀁉􀁌􀁞􀁉􀁖􀁜􀁉􀁏􀁍􀁛􀀃􀁑􀁖􀀃􀁜􀁐􀁍􀀃􀁋􀁗􀁖􀃆􀁑􀁋􀁜􀀃􀁜􀁐􀁉􀁜􀀃􀁋􀁗􀁝􀁔􀁌􀀃􀁔􀁑􀁍􀀃􀁉􀁐􀁍􀁉􀁌􀀖􀀃
