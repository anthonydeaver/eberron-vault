## Overview

Well known as a training ground for arcane spellcasters and dragonmarked heirs. The Fabricators Guild has a reputation for reliable goods. Guild shops offer equipment, and some accept commissions for unusual nonmagical items. Though most guild members keep to cities, some heirs travel with caravans and ships, to create or repair equipment.
