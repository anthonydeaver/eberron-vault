+ Age of Dragons<br />**Unknown**
+ 
+ - According to myth, the three [Progenitor Wyrms](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Progenitor_Dragons "Progenitor Dragons") created reality itself, weaving the thirteen planes into existence, each a concept founding the material plane. The three were alleged to create (or discover) the Draconic Prophecy. Though, eventually Khyber sought to claim dominion over the reality that she and her siblings had created and a battle ensued. She struck Siberys unprovoked, tearing the dragon apart. Eberron, knowing she could not defeat Khyber in battle, wrapper her coils around Khyber, becoming a living prison that would forever contain the wyrm's evil.
- In the aftermath, Sibery's shattered body became the golden ring of [dragonshards](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonshard "Dragonshard") that wrap around the planet; Eberron became the world, the source of all natural life; and Khyber became the Underdark, the source of many evils to come.
+ Age of Demons<br />**-10,000,000**
+ 
+ - Khyber's fiendish offspring overrun the surface world, creating a hellish environment where [rakshasas](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Rakshasas "Rakshasas") and [night hags](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Hag#Night_Hag "Hag") rule supreme.
+ **-1,500,000**
+
+ - Dragons rediscover the Prophecy and rise from their primitive state to oppose their [demonic](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Demon "Demon") overlords. Unable to defeat the demonic hordes of the Dragon Below alone, the dragons ally with the [couatls](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Couatl "Couatl").
- The common races, still in primitive states, hide from the godlike combatants and find a way to survive.
+ **-100,000**
+
+ - Recognizing their cause would otherwise be lost, the couatls sacrifice most of their number to bind the most powerful of the demon lords and the majority of the fiends back to Khyber. The couatls remain trapped for eternity with the fiends they bind. Victorious, the dragons retreat to [Argonnessen](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Argonnessen "Argonnessen") to contemplate the Prophecy, ignoring the "lesser races."
+ Age of Giants<br/>**-80,000**
+
+ - The [giants](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Giants "Giants") rise from the ruins of the [Dragon-Fiend Wars](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Demons "Age of Demons") to establish a civilization on the continent of [Xen'drik](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Xen%27drik "Xen'drik"). They enslave the [eladrin](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Eladrin "Eladrin") of the feyspire Shae Tirias Tolai, creating [elves](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Elves "Elves") and [drow](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Drow "Drow") through magic experiments.

After 1,000 years of battle, the giants call upon the most powerful magics of the dragons to throw Dal Quor out of planar alignment, forever sealing that plane away from Eberron. The resulting backlash shakes Xen'drik to its core and plunges large chunks of the continent beneath the sea.

+ **-39,000**
+
+ - 1,000 years after the end of the Giant-Quori War, Xen'drik is still suffering from the magical backlash of disrupting Dal Quor's planar orbit. Horrible curses and plagues still sweep through the land, and the elves use the opportunity to rebel.
- A corps of elves - called the [Phiarlan](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Phiarlan "Phiarlan") or "Spirit Keepers" - work as [bards](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Bards "Bards"), [scouts](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Scout "Scout"), and couriers during the elven rebellion against the giants.

- The Phiarlan spread the word of the elven prophet Aeren, gathering elves to flee Xen'drik for the sub-continent that would become known as [Aerenal](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Aerenal "Aerenal").
