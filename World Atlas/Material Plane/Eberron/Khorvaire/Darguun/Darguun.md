Darguun is a nation that broke off from [[Cyre]] during the Last War, when [[Compendium/Bestiary-old/Creatures G/Goblin|Goblin]] mercenaries seized the region for their own. The nation has become a host for many members of their race seeking a homeland including hobgoblins and bugbears. Some believe it will allow them to return to the glories of the ancient [[Dhakaani Empire]].

## Relationships

[[House Deneith]]: The rebellion of the goblinoid mercenaries in 969 YK was a terrible embarrassment for [[House Deneith]]. Nevertheless, the leaders of the house have since established a strong relationship with Haruuc. The [[Compendium/Bestiary-old/Creatures H-K/Hobgoblin|Hobgoblin]] warlord appreciates the legitimacy he gains through the association, while [[House Deneith]] needs the mercenary troops Haruuc provides. In addition to its outpost inside [[Rhukaan Draal]], [[House Deneith]] maintains a fortress a short distance away from the capital city. Known as the [[Gathering Stone]], this fortress serves as a staging area and training center for mercenaries who have agreed to serve the house.

 

[[House Tharashk]]: The prospectors of [[House Tharashk]] have taken a great interest in the potential mineral wealth of the Seawall Mountains since the end of the Last War. Unable to reach agreement with [[Zilargo]] to mine from the western side, agents of the house have been negotiating with the goblinoid tribes to approach the mountains from the east. However, the [[Compendium/Bestiary-old/Creatures O-R/Orc|Orc]] heritage of Tharashk works against this plan; many of the [[Compendium/Bestiary-old/Creatures H-K/Hobgoblin|Hobgoblin]] leaders harbor strong prejudice against the orcs. [[House Tharashk]] has established an outpost in [[Rhukaan Draal]] in hopes of strengthening its position in the kingdom and reaching an agreement that proves benefi cial to all sides. 

 

Goblinoids (general): Each of the three goblinoid tribes is multiracial and consists of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. It isn’t too unusual to find members of other races among the tribes. Some of these have embraced the goblinoid traditions and fought for a place of honor within the clans. Others are slaves, working for the benefit and amusement of their goblinoid masters. 

## Additional Details

The nation is almost unique in [[Khorvaire]] as it practices slavery against the Code of Galifar. Slaves are treated as cattle in this land with no rights and an ever present need for more to be delivered or captured. The land is currently united by the warlord [[Lhesh Haruuc]] but expected to explode into violence with the death of its current warchief.
