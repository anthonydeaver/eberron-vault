## Tactics

Rorsa and the wolves have no experience fi ghting spellcasters. They typically engage the closest target. All three try to use their trip ability to keep foes off balance. Rorsa is a cautious fighter and generally uses Combat Expertise to add 5 points to her AC.

## Rewards

Blue keycharm, green keycharm, pearl of power (1st level). All these items are mounted on fi ne chains, and Rorsa wears them around her neck.
