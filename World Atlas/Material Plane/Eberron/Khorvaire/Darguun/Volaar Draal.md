## Overview

Thousands of years ago the [[Dhakaani]] clans carved their fortresses into the roots of the [[Seawall Mountains]]. Volaar Draal, the stronghold of the [[Kech Volaar]] clan, is hidden deep beneath the peaks and crags. Its vast underhalls contain fungus fields that produce food for the city, forges for armorers, libraries and vaults to house the relics of the empire, and a great cavern in which [[Kech Volaar]] troops perform battle drills. The stonework easily matches the best the dwarves of the [[Mror Holds]] can produce. Few outsiders are allowed to visit these wondrous vaults.
