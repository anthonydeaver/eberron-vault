## Overview

**Type**: Clan

## Profile

The Bladebearers, named for a powerful artifact in their possession, are the largest of the [[Dhakaani]] clans. For thousands of years the [[Dhakaani]] clans have isolated themselves from the rest of the world, but they see the rise of [[Darguun]] as the fi rst sign of a restored [[Dhakaani Empire]]. Now the clans have emerged from their fortress caverns and are partaking in a brutal struggle to determine the rightful heir to the imperial throne. Since these battles are confined to the depths of the [[Seawall Mountains]] and do not involve outsiders, the [[Lhesh Haruuc]] has paid little attention to the conflict. But if one leader can win the loyalty of all the [[Dhakaani]] clans, he could challenge Haruuc for control of the [[Darguun]] nation. Chieftain [[Ruus Dhakaan]] (LN male [[Compendium/Bestiary-old/Creatures H-K/Hobgoblin|Hobgoblin]], [[Campaigns/5etools Compendium/classes/fighter|fighter]] 13) seeks to prove his right to rule through conquest. Kech Shaarat has already absorbed two smaller clans, and it seems only a matter of time until Ruus has all of the [[Dhakaani]] forces under his control. He outwardly bows to the [[Lhesh Haruuc]]â€™s authority, but in his mountain lair considers his own word to be more powerful than that of the lowland pretender. His soldiers rarely leave the [[Seawall Mountains]]; they can be identified by sword-shaped brands on one or both forearms.
