## Overview

This is a True and Accurate timeline of the world of Eberron. I noticed that other Eberron Timelines posted around the internet were incorrect. Many of the dates listed were off by about 1,000 years. with the one exception of Christopher J. Monte's "The Grand History of Eberron" (which technically is more than just a timeline).

 

This timeline uses the common calendar of Khorvaire called the Galifar Calendar which was developed during the reign of King Galifar II, called "the Dark," and places it's year 1 at the year of the founding of the Kingdom of Galifar. (Year of the Kingdom or YK) so all dates prior to that year are negative numbers and all dates after are positive. (which is where I believe the other timelines got confused and ended up being off by so much.)

 

Note to other editors: These dates are accurate, please do not alter them to match other incorrect timelines posted elsewhere. Thank You.

 

The Age of Dragons

Date: Unknown In the mythic past, the world was one and the progenitor wyrms, the first and greatest of dragon-kind, ruled all. The three most powerful (Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber) discovered (or created) the Prophecy. Khyber and Siberys disagreed over the Prophecy and battled with one another. Khyber was victorious over Siberys, and sought to take control of the Prophecy, only to be attacked by Eberron. Eberron wrapped his coils about Khyber, trapping the evil wyrm.

 

In the end, Siberys' shattered body became the Dragon Above - the glowing ring that surrounds the world. Khyber, still trapped in Eberron's coils, became the Dragon Below and the source for all great evils. Eberron healed the World Between by becoming one with it. Siberys called forth the next generation of dragons, Eberron created all manner of other living things, and Khyber spat out the fiends.

 

The Age of Demons

Date: -10,000,000 YK

 

Khyber's fiendish offspring overrun the surface world, creating a hellish enviroment where rakshasas and night hags rule supreme.

Date: -1,500,000 YK

 

Dragons rediscover the Prophecy and rise from their primitive state to oppose their demonic overlords. Unable to defeat the demonic hordes of the Dragon Below alone, the dragon ally with the couatls.

The common races, still in primitive states, hide from the godlike combatants and find a way to survive.

Date: -100,000 YK

 

Recognizing their cause would otherwise be lost, the Couatls sacrifice most of their number to bind the most powerful of the demon lords and the majority of the fiends back to Khyber. The couatl's remain trapped for eternity with the fiends they bind. Victorious, the dragons retreat to Argonnessen to contemplate the Prophecy, ignoring the "lesser races."

The Age of Giants

Date: -80,000 YK

 

The giants rise from the ruins of the Dragon-Fiend Wars to establish a civilization on the continent of Xen'drik. They enslave the primitive elves, which has the inadvertent effect of pulling the first of the common races out of their primitive state.

Date: -75,000 YK

 

Dragons and dragonborn come to Q'barra to guard Haka'torvhak

Date: -60,000 YK

Date: -40,000 YK

 

The quori invade Xen'drik from the plane of Dal Quor, the Plane of Dreams. After 1,000 years of battle, the giants call upon the most powerful magics of the dragons to throw Dal Quor out of planar alignment, forever sealing that plane away from Eberron. The resulting backlash shakes Xen'drik to its core and plunges large chunks of the continent beneath the sea.

Date: -39,000 YK

 

Event: 1,000 years after the end of the Giant-Quori war, Xen'drik is still suffering from the magical backlash of disrupting Dal Quor's planar orbit. Horrible curses and plagues still sweep through the land, and the elves use the opportunity to rebel.

A corp of elves - called the Phiarlan or "Spirit Keepers" - work as bards, scouts and couriers during the elven rebellion against the giants.

In a desperate attempt to regain control of their slaves and save their dying civilization, the giants turn again to the most powerful draconic magics. Before they can unleash such destruction a second time, the dragons attack Xen'drik and the giant civilization collapses.

The Phiarlan spread the word of the elven prophet Aeren, gathering elves to flee Xen'drik for the the sub-continent that would become known as Aerenal. The elves that chose to stay behind in Xen'drik and go into hiding, become the drow.

The Age of Monsters

The daelkyr - a race of immensely powerful beings from Xoriat, the plane of madness - invade Eberron. They are eventually defeated by the Gatekeeper druids, who seal the portals to Xoriat and trap the remaining daelkyr below ground, but not before decimating the western reaches of Khorvaire.

Date: -4,000 YK
