## Overview

**Type**: Mercenary
![Iconography!](jjhxzzmq.yxk.png)

Originally a group of elite shock-trooper style knights under the crown of Karrnath, the Order of the Emerald Claw has since been outlawed in Karrnath and has gone underground. 

 

They continue to operate in a semi-terrorist fashion to this day, proclaiming their desire to see Karrnath once again rise to power and garnering support from the Blood of Vol. The Order of the Emerald Claw is spread throughout Khorvaire.

## Story

The reputation of the knightly Order of the Emerald Claw has gone from one extreme to the other. When it was established, the order was considered the ultimate expression of Karrnathi patriotism. Today, it has been outlawed and is seen as a terrorist organization working at crosspurposes to the legitimate government of the nation. The secret truth beyond the origin of the order and the evil it serves is terrifying. 

 

On the surface, the Order of the Emerald Claw appears to consist of a small number of fanatics dedicated to the military superiority of a Karrnath that doesn’t want their devotion. In reality, the order has no interest in promoting or elevating Karrnath. Its true master, hidden to all but the top leaders within the organization, is Vol, the self-styled Queen of the Dead. 

 

This seemingly small group is like an iceberg; the tip that rises above the surface is nothing compared to the mountain of ice hidden beneath the waves. The Order supports a vast network whose tendrils wind through all levels of Khorvairian society. It has eyes and ears in the halls of government, churches, dragonmarked houses, and private institutions. Some of its agents never reveal their true nature; others appear proudly in the knightly garb of the order. 

 

Vol uses the Order of the Emerald Claw to incite fear and terror, to cast suspicion on the actions of Karrnath and its leaders, to foment unrest, and to perform military missions that go beyond the capabilities of her followers within the Blood of Vol. Knights of the order scour the world for relics and artifacts of powerful magic, and aren’t above stealing arcane research from wizards and artificers to churn out new magic weapons for the order or for Vol. 

 

The garb worn by the knights of the order includes a distinctive helmet with a half faceplate, a tabard with a claw insignia over chainmail, and a powerful flail.

## Organization

**Leader(s)**: The Queen of Death

The leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw is known as The Queen of Death by most members, a mysterious lich who controls the entire order with the help of the Crimson Covenant. Due to the collapse of the order after being officially outlawed from Karrnath the order cannot simply go about its business like it did during war times. Now the order has been broken into numerous cells spread out over Khorvaire. The leaders of each of these cells are officers who receive orders from the Crimson Covenant. Below these officers are the knights who're proven specialist warriors. Next are the troopers who are either cultists, criminals or Karrnathi patriots. Spies are used by the order along with mercenaries when required.

## Background

The Order of the Emerald Claw was established in 896YK and soon after came to the aid of Karrnath during the war. With perfect timing during a period where Karrnath was on its last legs this group of warrior fanatics came to its rescue and bolstered its defenses. Due to its radical faith many distrusted the Order of the Emerald Claw and soon the distrust turned into scorn so strong that Regent Moranna staged a coup and outlawed the Order of the Emerald Claw in 976YK. The group still exists today but only as a shadow of its former self living like terrorists and guerrilla fighters.

## Additional Details

The Order of the Emerald Claw makes a good villainous group without any moral ambiguity. The Order is known for its use of distinctive helmets with half-faceplates.
