## Overview

**Type**: Government

**Government Role**: Leadership

The gnomish nation of Zilargo is ruled by the Triumvirate, which was originally formed to govern the Library of Korranberg and its colleges and students, but was chosen as the general form of government to unite the various gnomish city-states against the war machine of Malleon the Reaver, a human warlord who lived in the era of conflict and exploration following the arrival of Lhazaar to Khorvaire from Sarlona. A triumvir is chosen for each of Zilargo's largest cities: Korranberg, Trolanport, and Zolanberg.
