## Lady Elaydren Vown d'Cannith
**Early Years and Upbringing**
Elaydren was born an only child into the Vown family, one of the leading families within Cannith and hugely influential in the House (more than half of all Cannith Patriarchs come from the Vown line). She was born of a union of her mother, Trana Vown d'Cannith, with Merrath ir'Wynarn, who would later come to be known as 'The Bard', and as a result she carries his tainted, infernal blood - a fact she keeps extremely close to her chest (not least because it means she isn't a member of the Vown bloodline, as her mother married into it).

Elaydren spent her earliest years growing up in Whitehearth, isolated from almost any other children until she was around seven, when her mother persuaded her sister - the future Baron Jorlanna d'Cannith - to take her in and look after her in a place where she could make friends her own age. It was also, however, to prevent young Elaydren from hurting herself - she was by nature an inquisitive child, constantly getting where she wasn't supposed to be.

Her life took quite a while to improve once she got to Fairhaven. She was used to adult company, and she suddenly found herself isolated from adults and around only children, who she felt were distinctlyâ€¦ childish. As a result, in spite of Jorlanna's increasingly busy life, Jorlanna was forced to take more time to look after Elaydren. As she grew older, she and Jorlanna grew closer.

**Self-Imposed Exile**
Then, when Elaydren was 17, she became one of the few to know about Jorlanna's affair with a House Deneith scion. In the aftermath, Jorlanna was removed from public view for a year - and from Elaydren. Elaydren, in turn, refused to either return to her mother's care in Whitehearth or to remain in Fairhaven, and went to become one of the earliest campaigners for Warforged rights, as part of a movement that grew up in Vathirond called 'Forged Right' (the group has dispersed since the Treaty of Thronehold).

When Jorlanna was released again, Elaydren didn't go right back to her. Knowing she would have a tendency to infernal behaviour - shady, back room wheeling and dealing - she decided to try to fight her inherited legacy by being chaotic and principled. This lead to her spending time bouncing between important politicians from many different countries and houses and onto some of the front line battlefields of the Last War. Supposedly as part of her activism, she saw some fairly horrific things during these days, and they shaped her from the arrogant, presumptuous daughter of Cannith into someone a lot more worldly - and jaded. These are not memories that will ever leave her, and she retains a discomfort with conflict to this day. She also, much to her own concern, found that there was a part of her that really liked the mayhem of war.

**Fairhaven and Elaydren the Diplomat**
Upon returning to Fairhaven - she still had no inclination to go back to live with her mother and "father" (step-father, but the rest of the family were told he was her father), with whom she had a cool relationship at best - she went back to live with Jorlanna. Over the next few years, she maintained the relationship with the rest of her family out in Whitehearth, visiting them regularly, but it was Jorlanna who mentored her and taught her - and it was under Jorlanna's guidance that she really started to tap into her power as a sorcerer. From Jorlanna too, she learned how to sway others, and developed a force of personality in her own right - as well as learned how to behave politically.

This is the skill she learned that drove what came next. Elaydren took up diplomatic duties for the house and in this role spent the next few years representing the house in negotiations for contracts. A lot of her time was spent in Breland, representing house interests there - in no small part because of her interest in the progressive culture and society of that country, hearkening back to her younger, more carefree days.

**The Aftermath of the Day of Mourning**
On the day that would leave the world and her house changed forever, Elaydren had just arrived at her home in Fairhaven when she became one of the people unfortunate enough to received a message containing the last words from someone trapped inside Cyre - in this case, her mother. Elaydren had just returned from a trip to see her mother and family at Whitehearth. The message was brief, desperate and incomprehensible - and one which will haunt Elaydren until she passes to Dolurrh.

In the wake of the event that left House Cannith leaderless and the world reeling, Elaydren clung on to Jorlanna - the only familiar face she trusted left. It took her quite a long time to realize that she, as had almost everyone in House Cannith who survived that day, lost almost everyone she knew in one go. Her life became unstuck, and she felt as though she had no roots left. Jorlanna was the one who brought her to her senses and gave her a renewed sense of purpose - to help the healing and rebuilding of House Cannith.

**Heir of Vown**
As the most influential of the Cannith family lines, the Vown family was mostly based inside Cyre, and was the family most severely reduced on the Day of Mourning. As such, Elaydren had now become next in line - after her old, barely functional great Uncle Iganden Vown d'Cannith - to become the head of the family. With this position came most of the Vown family holdings outside Cyre and influence over the Cannith Viceroys from the Vown family line.

Had Elaydren been a little older and more experienced, in fact, Elaydren could have been a candidate to become the new Patriarch with the backing of what's left of the Vown. Instead, having been based in Aundair and in the inner circle of Jorlanna, she chose to support Jorlanna's gathering claim to the title of Patriarch - and so, Elaydren became a representative of and diplomat for the newly forming Cannith West. With Elaydren's support, and the support of other remaining prominent Cannith figures, Jorlanna was in a position to declare herself Baron and candidate for Patriarch.

**Elaydren, Cannith West Liaison**
Elaydren was close enough to Jorlanna to discover that she was courting a young Dragonmarked heir of House Orien. Having grown to be a renowned diplomat, she was savvy enough to realize that she had no choice but to put some distance between herself from Jorlanna (while still maintaining cordial relations with her Aunt). She became Cannith West's permanent liaison with Cannith South.

It was in this capacity that she met Merrix d'Cannith. She was immediately struck by his obvious talent for artifice, leading her to recognize that he was also a worthy successor to the late Starrin d'Cannith.

At first, she served faithfully as the link between Cannith West and South, hoping that perhaps the two could be reunited and a compromise found that would force Cannith East to accept a full Patriarch. However, Elaydren soon found herself more and more enamoured of Merrix, as she began to understand the full extent of his genius.

**Defection to Cannith South**
Justifying her own actions to herself as helping House Cannith as a whole (and in no small way due to Jorlanna's indiscretions), Elaydren is now steadily becoming more and more loyal to Merrix over Jorlanna. It helps that he is gifted, in the way that his line has been, and that she finds him very attractive, of course. Merrix, for his part, realized what was happening and has gradually taken more and more advantage of Elaydren.

She currently works for both Cannith South and Cannith West, though she harbours feelings of loyalty for the principles of Cannith Lost.

Now
Elaydren's current location is unknown, having been sent on a mission to hide and keep Xulo safe.
