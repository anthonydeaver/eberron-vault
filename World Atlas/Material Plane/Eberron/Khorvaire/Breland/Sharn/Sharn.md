# <center>Sharn</center>

## Overview

**Government**: Council

**Organizations**: The Council of Sharn, The Lord Mayor, The King's Citadel, The Sixty Families of Sharn

Sharn is the most populous city in all of [[Khorvaire]], and arguably all of Eberron. The city literally towers atop a cliff above the mouth of the Dagger River in southern [[Breland]].

Sharn is known as The City of Towers, but has also been called many other names, including The City of Knives, The City of Lost Souls, The City of a Thousand Eyes, the Gateway to Xen'drik, and The Gateway to Perdition.

## Description

Sharn looms atop the cliffs overlooking the Hilt, a bay at the mouth of the Dagger River in southern [[Breland]]. The city sits upon the foundation of an ancient [[Compendium/Bestiary-old/Creatures H-K/Hobgoblin|Hobgoblin]] city. Below that, a rumored lake of molten lava rests, but its presence can be felt only in the lowest parts of Sharn, the Cogs.

The inhospitable outcropping that Sharn sits on allows the city to grow only in vertical height. This might have been a problem for other cities, but Sharn happens to be located within a manifest zone linked to the plane of Syrania, the Azure Sky. The manifest zone enhances magic that creates flight and levitation. This allows Sharn to have towers that rise nearly a mile in height, transportational flight, and even a section of the city that floats above the highest towers.
